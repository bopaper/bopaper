%% Background %%
%%
\section*{Background}
The Blue Obelisk movement was established in 2005 at the
229\textsuperscript{th} National Meeting of the American Chemistry
Society as a response to the lack of open data, open standards and
open source (ODOSOS) in chemistry. While other scientific disciplines
such as physics, biology and astronomy (to name a few) were embracing
new ways of doing science and reaping the benefits of community
efforts, there was little if any innovation in the field of chemistry
and scientific progress was actively hampered by the lack of access to
data and tools.
Since 2005 it has become evident that a good amount of development in open 
chemical information and information is driven by the demands of neighbouring
scientific fields. In many areas in biology, for example, the importance of 
small molecules and their interactions and reactions in biological systems
has been realised. In fact, one of the first free and open databases and ontologies 
of small molecules was created as a resource about chemical structure and nomenclature
by biologists \cite{DeMatos:2009p3839}.
Open workflow systems such as Taverna \cite{Hull:2006p60} and KNIME\cite{WebKNIME}
have opened the door for 
an easy and seamless integration of FOS components into executable workflows 
or data pipelines. A combination of the Chemistry Development Kit and Taverna, for instance, was
reported in 2010 \cite{Kuhn:2010p4001}. 

KNIME currently has a built-in collection of CDK-based and
OpenBabel-based nodes\cite{WebKNIMEExtensions} for implementing
chemistry workflows. Another collection of chemistry nodes---based on
the RDKit and its Java wrapper---appeared in 2010 and is available to
KNIME users from the KNIME's official ``Community Updates'' site.
Indigo nodes for KNIME are in preparation and will appear nearby the
RDKit nodes by May 2011.

The formation of the Blue Obelisk group is somewhat unusual in that it
is not a funded network, nor does it follow the industry consortium
model. Rather it is a grassroots organisation, catalysed by an initial
core of interested scientists, but with membership open to all who
share one or more of the goals of the group:
\begin{itemize}
\item Open Source. One can use other people's code without further
permission, including changing it for one's own use and distributing
it again.
\item Open Standards. One can find visible community mechanisms for
protocols and communicating information. The mechanisms for creating
and maintaining these standards cover a wide spectrum of human
organisations, including various degrees of consent.
\item Open Data. One can obtain all data in the public domain when
wanted and reuse it for whatever purpose.
\end{itemize}

The Blue Obelisk was first described in the CDK News \cite{CDKNewsBO} and
later as a formal paper by Guha et al.\cite{Guha2006} in
2006. This
contribution looks back on the past 5 years and surveys progress and
remaining challenges in the areas of Open Source, Open Data and Open
Standards in chemistry.

\section*{Open Source}
  \subsection*{Progress}

\subsubsection*{Cheminformatics toolkits}

Open Source toolkits for cheminformatics have now existed for nearly
ten years. During this period, some toolkits were developed from
scratch in academia, whereas others were made Open Source by releasing in-house
codebases under liberal licenses. When the Blue Obelisk was
established five years ago, the primary toolkits under active development
were the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK)
\cite{Steinbeck2003, Steinbeck2006}, Open Babel \cite{WebOpenBabel},
and JOELib \cite{WebJOELib}. Of these, both the CDK and Open Babel
continue to be actively developed. [Insert main focus of work on CDK
in last 5 years] Since 2006, major new features of Open Babel include 3D structure
generation and 2D structure-diagram generation, UFF and MMFF94
forcefields, and significantly expanded support for computational
chemistry calculations. In addition, a major focus of Open Babel development
has been to fix problems in the areas of stereochemistry, kekulisation
and canonicalisation.

Some project have also been adopted by other fields, including biology
and crystallography. A good example
here is Jmol, which has, in the past five years, gone through two major revisions
as part of an accelerated development focus. Starting with Jmol 10.2, released in
April of 2006, Jmol 11.0 added over 100 new features and was released in March of
2007. Three years later, Jmol 12.0 followed with over 700 new features.
Based on the outstanding work of Michael (Miguel) Howard and others, this development
path took Jmol from a "Rasmol/Chime replacement" to a fully fledged molecular
visualization package, including full support for crystallography~\cite{Hanson2010},
efficient delivery of surface data using fast solvent-excluded surface
generation and the highly compressed JVXL format [http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/docs/misc/JVXL-format.pdf],
 display of molecular orbitals from standard basis set/coefficient data,
the inclusion of dynamic minimization using the UFF force field, and
a full implementation of Daylight SMILES and SMART, with extensions to
conformational and biomolecular substructure searching in the form of Jmol
BioSMARTS.[http://jmol.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jmol/trunk/Jmol/src/org/jmol/smiles/package.html]
Behind the scenes, Jmol has been essentially completely rewritten. A full
mathematical expression evaluator was added, and the scripting language
was folded into a versatile JavaScript-like command language, including a
complete set of program flow commands, several new data types, and
user-defined variables and functions. An exciting non-chemical application
of Jmol has been its incorporation into the open source Sage
Mathematics Project [http://www.sagemath.org/], where Jmol is being used
to deliver three-dimensional depiction of mathematical functions. 

Two new Open Source cheminformatics toolkits have appeared since the
original paper. In 2006 Rational Discovery, a cheminformatics service
company (since closed down), released RDKit \cite{WebRDKit} under the
BSD License. RDKit continues to be actively developed and includes
code donated by Novartis.

More recently, GGA Software Services (a contract programming company)
released the Indigo toolkit \cite{WebIndigo} and associated software
in 2009 under the GPL. Indigo is written from scratch in C++ and has
high-level wrappers for using it in C, Java, Python, or .NET
environment. Like other toolkits, Indigo provides support for
tetrahedral and cis-trans stereochemistry, 2D coordinate generation,
exact/substructure/SMARTS matching, fingerprint generation (all these
both for molecules and reactions), and canonical SMILES computation.
It also provides some less common functionality, like matching
tautomers ans resonance substructures, enumeration of subgraps,
finding maximum common substructure of $N$ input structures, and
enumerating reaction products. Indigo also has its rendering plugin,
which is used in a lot of commercial and open-source projects as the
main 2D chemical rendering engine.

One important aspect of the above
toolkits is that they originated for the support of desktop
and server-side applications. More recently, a number of workers have developed light-weight
toolkits that are targeted towards web applications. One example of
this form is the ChemDoodle library from iChemLabs. The focus of these
toolkits is to support client-side cheminformatics functionality,
allowing for rich, chemically-aware browser-based applications.

\subsubsection*{Second-generation tools}

Although feature-rich and robust cheminformatics toolkits are useful
in and of themselves, they can also be seen as providing a base layer
on which additional tools and applications can be built. This is one
of the reasons that cheminformatics toolkits are so important to the
open source `ecosystem'; their availability lowers the barrier for the
development of a `second generation' of chemistry software that no
longer needs to concern itself with the low-level details of
manipulating chemical structures, and can focus on providing
additional functionality and ease-of-use.

Bioclipse~\cite{Spjuth:2007fk} (v2.4 released in Aug 2010) and Avogadro
\cite{WebAvogadro} (v1.0 in Oct 2009) are two examples of such
software, based on the CDK and Open Babel, respectively. Bioclipse is
an award-winning molecular workbench for life sciences with a dynamic plugin architecture, and which wraps cheminformatics functionality behind user-friendly interfaces and graphical editors. All functionality in Bioclipse is completely scriptable using an integrated high-level language called Bioclipse Scripting Language (BSL), which can be used for scripted research or to automate complex tasks~\cite{Bioclipse2}.

Avogadro is a 3D molecular editor and viewer aimed at preparing
and analysing computational chemistry calculations. An interesting
aspect of both of these projects is that they share some developers
with the underlying toolkit and this has driven the development of new
features in the CDK and Open Babel.

CDK-Taverna \cite{Kuhn:2010p4001} as an open-source cheminformatics workflow solution.
Commonly used in this context are workflow engines for cheminformatics, where numerous recurring tasks can be automated, including tasks for chemical data filtering, transformation, curation and migration workflows, chemical documentation and information retrieval related workflows (structures, reactions, pharma- cophores, object relational data etc.) or data analysis workflows (statistics and clustering/ machine learning for QSAR, diversity analysis etc. 
CDK-Taverna has matured to become a freely available and increasingly powerful tool for the biosciences. It was recently ported to 
Taverna version 2.x.
The combination of CDK-Taverna workers with the multitude of workers already published on myexperiment.org by the large and active user community of Taverna enables scientists to quickly build workflows to process a diverse set of data as typically found in today's systems biology scenarios.

Some other recent projects that build on Blue Obelisk software include
AMBIT (a GUI that facilitates registration of chemicals for the REACH
EU directive on toxicity, based on the CDK), etc.

\subsubsection*{The business end}

Although the software developed by the Blue Obelisk is Open Source on
principle, this does not rule out the establishment of a business
based on open source chemistry software. Rather than supporting itself
through sales, such a business generally relies on providing support,
customisation and services around the software. The interaction
between an open source project and a company is important, and works
best where there is some form of `giving back' to the project (such as
developer time, code contributions, or financial assistance with server costs).

An example of such an interaction was the donation by eMolecules, Inc.
to Open Babel of code for the canonicalisation of molecules and
fragments (Nov 2006). eMolecules is an online vendor of chemicals that
uses Open Babel under-the-hood to manage its compound collections.
Another more recent example occurred in July 2010 when Silicos, a
Belgian company that provides services
in the area of cheminformatics, released several command line
applications based on Open Babel as well as donating code to the
project. For example, the Pharao
tool released by them is a comprehensive solution for pharmacophore
searching that provides extensive support for a variety of
pharmacophore searches. Other tools released by them include Sieve for
filtering by molecular property and XXX.

Another example of Open Source
tools originating from commercial groups is the ChemCraft tool from
Molecular Networks GmBH, that does XXX.

Rather than releasing new tools, an alternative approach to provide an
interface to existing tools. hBar Solutions has developed an online
portal, hBar Lab, for managing and performing computational chemistry
calculations in the cloud. To do so it leverages two Blue Obelisk
projects, Jmol and Open Babel, as well as the open source quantum
mechanics packages MPQC.

  \subsubsection*{Collaboration and interoperability}

One of the effects of the Blue Obelisk has been to bring developers
together from different Open Source chemistry projects so that they
look for opportunities to collaborate rather than compete, and to
leverage work done by other projects to avoid duplication of effort.
As an example of this, when in March 2008 the Jmol development team
were looking to add support for energy minimisation, rather than
implement a forcefield from scratch they ported the UFF forcefield
implementation from Open Babel to Jmol. This code has allowed Jmol to
support 2D to 3D conversion of structures (through energy
minimisation). Similarly, efficient Jmol code for atom-atom rebonding
has been ported to the CDK.

Another collaborative initiative between Blue Obelisk projects was the establishment in May 2008 of
the ChemiSQL project. This brought together the developers of several
open source chemistry database cartridges (PgChem, MyChem, OrChem and
more recently Bingo) with a view to making their database APIs more
similar and collaborating on benchmark datasets for assessing
performance. For two of these projects, PgChem and MyChem, which are both based on
Open Babel, there is the additional possibility of working together on a shared
codebase.

In the area of cheminformatics tookits, two of the existing toolkits
Open Babel and RDKit are planning to work together on a common
underlying framework called MolCore. This project is still in the
planning stage, but if it is a success it will mean that the two
libraries will be interoperable (while retaining their existing focus)
but also that the cost of maintaining the code will be shared among
more developers, freeing time for the development of new features.

One of the goals of the Blue Obelisk is to promote interoperability in chemical
informatics. When barriers exist to moving chemical data between
different software, the community becomes fragmented and there is
the danger of vendor lock-in (where users are constrained to using
a particular software, a situation which puts them at a
disadvantage). This applies as much to Open Source software as to
proprietary software. Cinfony is a project (first release in May 2008)
whose goal is to tackle this problem in the area of cheminformatics
toolkits \cite{OBoyleCinfony2008}.
It is a Python library that enables Open Babel, the CDK, and RDKit to
be used using the same API; this makes it easy, for example, to read a
molecule using Open Babel, calculate descriptors using the CDK and
create a depiction using RDKit.

  \subsection*{Remaining challenges}

Accuracy. Very often software work at the 95\% to 98\% level. The
variety of chemical structures is such that with a large enough
dataset, 'unusual' structures are always found which may be mishandled
by software. Given that much of the development of open source
software is unfunded, and relies heavily on developer motivation, it
is understandable that working on the final N\% of problem structures
(which may require substantial work) is not the most exciting of
tasks. Putting a bounty system in place may be useful for these
situations where a researcher needs a problem to be fixed because it
affects a particular dataset of interest.

Performance. There is a famous quote by Knuth that "Premature
optimization is root of all evil (or something)". Given that compute
time is cheap, ....

\section*{Chemical Structure Registration Systems, Databases}
Databases? (XXX CS: A couple of database-related paragraphs could go here XXX)

XXX the paragraph below on OrChem needs some work
Registration, indexing and searching of chemical structures in relational databases is one of the core areas of cheminformatics. 
A number of structure registration systems have been published in the last five years, exploiting the fact that 
free cheminformatics toolkits such as OpenBabel and the CDK were available. 
OrChem, for example, is an extension for the Oracle 11G database that adds registration and indexing of chemical structures to support fast substructure and similarity searching. The cheminformatics functionality is provided by the Chemistry Development Kit. OrChem provides similarity searching with response times in the order of seconds for databases with millions of compounds, depending on a given similarity cut-off. For substructure searching, it can make use of multiple processor cores on today's powerful database servers to provide fast response times in equally large data sets.
OrChem is free software and can be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation. All software is available via http://orchem.sourceforge.net.

\section*{Open Standards}
  \subsection*{Progress}

The IUPAC InChI identifier is a non-proprietary and unique identifier
for chemical substances designed to enable linking of diverse data
compilations. Although its development predates the Blue Obelisk,
software such as Open Babel has included InChI support since 2005.
Since the official InChI implementation is in C, it is difficult to
access from the other widely used language for cheminformatics
toolkits, Java. The Blue Obelisk project JNI-InChI has been set up to
solve this problem by using the Java Native Interface to link the
InChI binary to Java. In this way, it promotes the wider adoption of
this standard identifier by the chemistry community.

Also, Indigo is going to provide its own plugin with an interface to
the InChI implementation in May 2011. This will enable developers to
calculate InChI and InChIKey-s within Python and .NET projects (not to
mention Java), eliminating the trouble of compiling and using binary
modules directly.

    \subsubsection*{OpenSMILES}

One of the most widely used ways to store chemical structures is the
SMILES format (or SMILES string). This is a linear notation depicted
by Daylight Information Systems that describes the connection table
of a molecule and may optionally encode chirality. Its popularity
stems from the fact that it is a compact representation of the
chemical structure that is human readable and writable, and is
convenient to manipulate (e.g. to include in spreadsheets, or copy
from a Wikipedia article).

Despite its widespread use, a formal
definition of the language did not exist beyond Daylight's SMILES
Theory Manual and tutorials. This caused some confusion in the
implementation and interpretation of corner cases, for example the
handling of cis/trans bond symbols at ring closures. In 2007, Craig
James (eMolecules) initiated work on the OpenSMILES specification, a
complete specification of the SMILES language as an Open Standard
developed through a community process. The specification is largely
complete and contains guidelines on reading SMILES, a formal
grammar, recommendations on standard forms when writing SMILES, as
well as proposed extensions.

Recently proposed CurlySMILES\cite{CurlySMILES} is an extension of the
SMILES notation, which allows to define crystals structures, polymers,
electron delocalization charges, molecule interations, and many other
features absent in the initial SMILES specification. There has been
discussions about including parts of the CurlySMILES notation into
OpenSMILES, especially polymers.

\subsubsection*{CML}
?

\subsubsection*{QSAR-ML}
The field of QSAR has long been hampered by the lack of open standards, which makes it difficult to share and reproduce descriptor calculations and analyses. QSAR-ML was recently proposed as an open standard for exchanging QSAR datasets~\cite{Spjuth:2010uq}. A dataset in QSAR-ML includes the chemical structures (preferable described in CML) with InChI to protect integrity, chemical descriptors by linking to the Blue Obelisk Descriptor Ontology~\cite{bodo}, response values, units, and versioned descriptor implementations to allow for integrating several descriptor software in the same calculation. Hence, a dataset described in QSAR-ML is completely reproducible. To allow for easy setup of QSAR-ML compliant datasets, a plugin for Bioclipse was created with graphical interfaces that can be used to set up QSAR datasets and perform calculations. Descriptor implementations were initially available from CDK and JoeLIB, as well as via remote web services such as XMPP~\cite{Wagener:2009uq}.


\subsubsection*{Others...?}

Pistoia Alliance (and others?) should be mentioned at this point

  \subsection*{Remaining challenges}

A core requirement for chemical structure databases and chemical
registration systems in general is the notion of structure
standardization.  That is,  for a given input structure, multiple
representations should be converted to one canonical form. 
Structure canonicalization routines partially address this aspect,
converting multiple alternative topologies to a single canonical
form. However, the problem of standardization is broader than just
topological canonicalization. Features that must be considered include
\begin{itemize}
\item topological canonicalization
\item handling of charges
\item tautomer enumeration and canonicalization
\item normalization of functional groups
\end{itemize}
Currently, most of the individual components of a `standardization
pipeline' can be implemented using BO tools. The larger problem is
that there is no agreed upon list of steps for a standardization
process. While some specifications have been published (e.g., Pubchem)
and some standardization services and tools are available (Pubchem
provides an online service to standardise molecules and the NCGC
provides a stand alone tool) each group has their own set of rules. A
common reference specification for standardization would be of immense
value in interoperability between structure repositories as well as
between toolkits (though the latter is still confounded by differences
in lower level cheminformatic features such as aromaticity models).

We have already discussed the development of an Open SMILES standard.
While much progress has been made towards a complete specification,
more remains to be done before this can be considered finished. After
that point, the next logical step would be to start work on a standard
for the SMARTS language, the extension to SMILES that specifies
patterns that match chemical substructures.

\section*{Open Data}
  \subsection*{Progress}

A considerable stumbling block in advocating the release of scientific
data as Open Data has been how exactly to define Open. A major step
forward was the launch in 2010 of the Panton Principles for Open Data
in Science \cite{WebPanton}. This formalises the idea that Open Data maximises the
possibility of reuse and repurposing, the fundamental basis
of how science works. These principles recommend that published data
be licensed explicitly, and preferably under CC0 (Creative Commons `No
Rights Reserved') \cite{WebCC0}. This license allows others to use the data for any
purpose whatsoever without any barriers.

\section*{Conclusions}

We have shown that the Blue Obelisk has been very successful
in bringing together researchers and developers with common interests
in ODOSOS, leading to development of many useful resources freely
available to the chemistry community. But how best to engage with the
wider chemistry community outside of the Blue Obelisk remains an open
question. If the Blue Obelisk is truly to make an impact,
then an attempt must be made to reach beyond the subscribers to the
BO mailing list and blogs of members.

One recent development
that attempts to address this issue was the establishment in Apr 2010 of a
question-and-answer
website related to Blue Obelisk projects and themes at
http://blueobelisk.shapado.com. This is a website in the
style of Stack Overflow that encourages high quality answers (and
questions) through the use of a voting system. In the year since it
was established, over
200 users have registered, many of whom had no previous involvement
with the Blue Obelisk.

We hope to see this involvement between the Blue Obelisk and the wider
community grow in the future. To this end, we encourage the reader to
visit http://blueobelisk.org, send a message to our mailing list,
investigate related projects or read our blogs.
