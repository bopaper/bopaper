%% Background %%
%%
\section*{Background}
The Blue Obelisk group was established in 200X at the 2XXth National Meeting of the American Chemistry Society as a response to the lack of open data, open standards and open source (ODOSOS) in chemistry. While other scientific disciplines such as physics, biology and astronomy (to name a few) were embracing new ways of doing science and reaping the benefits of community efforts, there was little if any innovation in the field of chemistry and scientific progress was actively hampered by the lack of access to data and tools.

The goals of the Blue Obelisk group were described in Guha et al.\cite{guha2006}. but are briefly summarised here...


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Main section %%
%%
\section*{Open Source}
  \subsection*{Progress}

...something about toolkits...

Although feature-rich and robust cheminformatics toolkits are useful in and of themselves, they can also be seen as providing a base layer on which tools and applications can be built. Now that these toolkits have reached an acceptable level of stability and functionality, an increasing amount of software is being developed using these toolkits. As an example of the interaction between the commercial and open source worlds, Silicos (a Belgian company that provides services in the area of cheminformatics XXXX rephrase), has released several command line applications based on Open Babel; Pharao for pharmacophore generation (Sept 2010?), Sieve for filtering by molecular property, ..... 

It is worth noting that Pharao is the first Open Source pharmacophore program (\emph{Is this a reasonable statement?}) (although pharmacophore-related functionality has been available in the CDK and RDKit for some time).

  \subsection*{Remaining challenges}

Accuracy. Very often software work at the 95\% to 98\% level. The variety of chemical structures is such that with a large enough dataset, 'unusual' structures are always found which may be mishandled by software. Given that much of the development of open source software is unfunded, and relies heavily on developer motivation, it is understandable that working on the final N\% of problem structures (which may require substantial work) is not the most exciting of tasks. Putting a bounty system in place may be useful for these situations where a researcher needs a problem to be fixed because it affects a particular dataset of interest.

Performance. There is a famous quote by Knuth that "Premature optimization is root of all evil (or something)". Given that compute time is cheap, ....

Databases?
