    abstract = {The {AMBIT} web services package is one of the several existing independent implementations of the {OpenTox} Application Programming Interface and is built according to the principles of the Representational State Transfer ({REST}) architecture. The Open Source Predictive Toxicology Framework, developed by the partners in the {EC} {FP7} {OpenTox} project, aims at providing a unified access to toxicity data and predictive models, as well as validation procedures. This is achieved by i) an information model, based on a common {OWL}-{DL} ontology ii) links to related ontologies; iii) data and algorithms, available through a standardized {REST} web services interface, where every compound, data set or predictive method has a unique web address, used to retrieve its Resource Description Framework ({RDF}) representation, or initiate the associated calculations. The {AMBIT} web services package has been developed as an extension of {AMBIT} modules, adding the ability to create (Quantitative) {Structure-Activity} Relationship ({QSAR}) models and providing an {OpenTox} {API} compliant interface. The representation of data and processing resources in {W3C} Resource Description Framework facilitates integrating the resources as Linked Data. By uploading datasets with chemical structures and arbitrary set of properties, they become automatically available online in several formats. The services provide unified interfaces to several descriptor calculation, machine learning and similarity searching algorithms, as well as to applicability domain and toxicity prediction models. All Toxtree modules for predicting the toxicological hazard of chemical compounds are also integrated within this package. The complexity and diversity of the processing is reduced to the simple paradigm "read data from a web address, perform processing, write to a web address". The online service allows to easily run predictions, without installing any software, as well to share online datasets and models. The downloadable web application allows researchers to setup an arbitrary number of service instances for specific purposes and at suitable locations. These services could be used as a distributed framework for processing of resource-intensive tasks and data sharing or in a fully independent way, according to the specific needs. The advantage of exposing the functionality via the {OpenTox} {API} is seamless interoperability, not only within a single web application, but also in a network of distributed services. Last, but not least, the services provide a basis for building web mashups, end user applications with friendly {GUIs}, as well as embedding the functionalities in existing workflow systems.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Compound profiling and drug screening generates large amounts of data and is generally based on microplate assays. Current information systems used for handling this are mainly commercial, closed source, expensive, and heavyweight and there is a need for a extensible lightweight open system for handling plate design, and validation and preparation of data.RESULTS:A Bioclipse plugin consisting of a client part and a relational database was constructed. A multiple-step plate layout point-and-click interface was implemented inside Bioclipse. The system contains a data validation step, where outliers can be removed, and finally a plate report with all relevant calculated data, including dose-response curves. CONCLUSIONS:Brunn is capable of handling the data from microplate assays. It can create dose-response curves and calculate IC50 values. Using a system of this sort facilitates work in the laboratory. Being able to reuse already constructed plates and plate layouts by starting out from an earlier step in the plate layout design process saves time and cuts down on error sources.},

However, these methods have severe drawbacks, including lack of discoverability, and the inability for services to send status notifications. Several complementary workarounds have been proposed, but the results are ad-hoc solutions of varying quality that can be difficult to use.},

@article{Spjuth:2010uq,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: QSAR is a widely used method to relate chemical structures to responses or properties based on experimental observations. Much effort has been made to evaluate and validate the statistical modeling in QSAR, but these analyses treat the dataset as fixed. An overlooked but highly important issue is the validation of the setup of the dataset, which comprises addition of chemical structures as well as selection of descriptors and software implementations prior to calculations. This process is hampered by the lack of standards and exchange formats in the field, making it virtually impossible to reproduce and validate analyses and drastically constrain collaborations and re-use of data. RESULTS: We present a step towards standardizing QSAR analyses by defining interoperable and reproducible QSAR datasets, consisting of an open XML format (QSAR-ML) which builds on an open and extensible descriptor ontology. The ontology provides an extensible way of uniquely defining descriptors for use in QSAR experiments, and the exchange format supports multiple versioned implementations of these descriptors. Hence, a dataset described by QSAR-ML makes its setup completely reproducible. We also provide a reference implementation as a set of plugins for Bioclipse which simplifies setup of QSAR datasets, and allows for exporting in QSAR-ML as well as old-fashioned CSV formats. The implementation facilitates addition of new descriptor implementations from locally installed software and remote Web services; the latter is demonstrated with REST and XMPP Web services. CONCLUSIONS: Standardized QSAR datasets open up new ways to store, query, and exchange data for subsequent analyses. QSAR-ML supports completely reproducible creation of datasets, solving the problems of defining which software components were used and their versions, and the descriptor ontology eliminates confusions regarding descriptors by defining them crisply. This makes it easy to join, extend, combine datasets and hence work collectively, but also allows for analyzing the effect descriptors have on the statistical model's performance. The presented Bioclipse plugins equip scientists with graphical tools that make QSAR-ML easily accessible for the community.},

We decided to develop an open source chemistry extension for Oracle, the de facto database platform in the commercial {world.RESULTS}:Here we present {OrChem}, an extension for the Oracle {11G} database that adds registration and indexing of chemical structures to support fast substructure and similarity searching. The cheminformatics functionality is provided by the Chemistry Development Kit. {OrChem} provides similarity searching with response times in the order of seconds for databases with millions of compounds, depending on a given similarity cut-off. For substructure searching, it can make use of multiple processor cores on today's powerful database servers to provide fast response times in equally large data {sets.AVAILABILITY}:{OrChem} is free software and can be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the {GNU} Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation. All software is available via http://orchem.sourceforge.net.},

@article{Bioclipse2,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Contemporary biological research integrates neighboring scientific domains to answer complex questions in fields such as systems biology and drug discovery. This calls for tools that are intuitive to use, yet flexible to adapt to new {tasks.RESULTS}:Bioclipse is a free, open source workbench with advanced features for the life sciences. Version 2.0 constitutes a complete rewrite of Bioclipse, and delivers a stable, scalable integration platform for developers and an intuitive workbench for end users. All functionality is available both from the graphical user interface and from a built-in novel domain-specific language, supporting the scientist in interdisciplinary research and reproducible analyses through advanced visualization of the inputs and the results. New components for Bioclipse 2 include a rewritten editor for chemical structures, a table for multiple molecules that supports gigabyte-sized files, as well as a graphical editor for sequences and {alignments.CONCLUSION}:Bioclipse 2 is equipped with advanced tools required to carry out complex analysis in the fields of bio- and cheminformatics. Developed as a Rich Client based on Eclipse, Bioclipse 2 leverages on today's powerful desktop computers for providing a responsive user interface, but also takes full advantage of the Web and networked ({Web/Cloud}) services for more demanding calculations or retrieval of data. The fact that Bioclipse 2 is based on an advanced and widely used service platform ensures wide extensibility, making it easy to add new algorithms, visualizations, as well as scripting commands. The intuitive tools for end users and the extensible architecture make Bioclipse 2 ideal for interdisciplinary and integrative {research.Bioclipse} 2 is released under the Eclipse Public License ({EPL}), a flexible open source license that allows additional plugins to be of any license. Bioclipse 2 is implemented in Java and supported on all major platforms; Source code and binaries are freely available at http://www.bioclipse.net.},

This has been achieved using an approach based on a regular grammar. This grammar is used to guide tokenization, a potentially difficult problem in chemical names. From the parsed chemical name, an {XML} parse tree is constructed that is operated on in a stepwise manner until the structure has been reconstructed from the name. Results from {OPSIN} on various computer generated name/structure pair sets are presented. These show exceptionally high precision (99.8\%+) and, when using general organic chemical nomenclature, high recall (98.7-99.2\%). This software can serve as the basis for future open source developments of chemical name interpretation.},
